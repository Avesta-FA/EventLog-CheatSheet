# EventLog-CheatSheet
Searching through event logs is a daunting task.  
This cheat sheet is made to be a simple way for security practitioners to go through all the logs and find adversary activity.  
Events can be written to event log channels and each event has an event ID.   
Common channels are:  
* Security
* System
* Application  

There are 4 channel types:  
* Common
	- Administrative 
	- Operational
* Uncommon
	- Debug
	- Analytic



Our main focus will be on the security channel because it's the most relevant.
